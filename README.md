libretro-prboom for Switch
===============

Port of prboom to libretro for Switch ported to libnx.

A custom retroarch.cfg provided to change the control scheme to a more modern "twin stick" one instead of a PSX Doom like scheme.

#Features

##Custom Wads

Doom/Doom2/Boom compatible wads can be loaded by simply selecting said custom WAD file when loading content. Just make sure that it's in the same directory as your doom/doom2.wad file.

##Music

Music does work, but requires the use of .MP3s due to some shenanigans with the midi engine. Simply Google search "prboom music", download your .MP3s, rename them to remove the "d_" in front and place them in the same directory as your IWAD.
